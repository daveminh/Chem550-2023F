Additionally, if the `save_to_google_drive` option was selected, the `jobname.result.zip` will be uploaded to your Google Drive.\n","\n","**MSA generation for complexes**\n","\n","For the complex prediction we use unpaired and paired MSAs. Unpaired MSA is generated the same way as for the protein structures prediction by searching the UniRef100 and environmental sequences three iterations each.\n","\n","The paired MSA is generated by searching the UniRef100 database and pairing the best hits sharing the same NCBI taxonomic identifier (=species or sub-species). We only pair sequences if all of the query sequences are present for the respective taxonomic identifier.\n","\n","**Using a custom MSA as input**\n","\n","To predict the structure with a custom MSA (A3M formatted): (1) Change the `msa_mode`: to \"custom\", (2) Wait for an upload box to appear at the end of the \"MSA options ...\" box. Upload your A3M. The first fasta entry of the A3M must be the query sequence without gaps. \n","\n","It is also possilbe to proide custom MSAs for complex predictions. Read more about the format [here](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold/issues/76).\n","\n","As an alternative for MSA generation the [HHblits Toolkit server](https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhblits) can be used. After submitting your query, click \"Query Template MSA\" -> \"Download Full A3M\". Download the A3M file and upload it in this notebook.\n","\n","**Using custom templates** <a name=\"custom_templates\"></a>\n","\n","To predict the structure with a custom template (PDB or mmCIF formatted): (1) change the `template_mode` to \"custom\" in the execute cell and (2) wait for an upload box to appear at the end of the \"Input Protein\" box. Select and upload your templates (multiple choices are possible).\n","\n","* Templates must follow the four letter PDB naming.\n","\n","* Templates in mmCIF format must contain `_entity_poly_seq`. An error is thrown if this field is not present. The field `_pdbx_audit_revision_history.revision_date` is automatically generated if it is not present.\n","\n","* Templates in PDB format are automatically converted to the mmCIF format. `_entity_poly_seq` and `_pdbx_audit_revision_history.revision_date` are automatically generated.\n","\n","If you encounter problems, please report them to this [issue](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold/issues/177).\n","\n","**Comparison to the full AlphaFold2 and Alphafold2 colab**\n","\n","This notebook replaces the homology detection and MSA pairing of AlphaFold2 with MMseqs2. For a comparison against the [AlphaFold2 Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/notebooks/AlphaFold.ipynb) and the full [AlphaFold2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) system read our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.15.456425v1). \n","\n","**Troubleshooting**\n","* Check that the runtime type is set to GPU at \"Runtime\" -> \"Change runtime type\".\n","* Try to restart the session \"Runtime\" -> \"Factory reset runtime\".\n","* Check your input sequence.\n","\n","**Known issues**\n","* Google Colab assigns different types of GPUs with varying amount of memory. Some might not have enough memory to predict the structure for a long sequence.\n","* Your browser can block the pop-up for downloading the result file.

The higher the better.\n","*   **Predicted Alignment Error** - For homooligomers, this could be a useful metric to assess how confident the model is about the interface.
