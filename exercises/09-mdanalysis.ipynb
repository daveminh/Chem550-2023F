are key-players in the formation of a ligand-protein complex ([_PLoS One._ (2010), **5(8)**, e12029](https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0012029), [_J. Med. Chem._ 2010, **53(14)**, 5061-84](https://doi.org/10.1021/jm100112j)). Their attractive potential results from a partially positively charged hydrogen pointing to a partially negatively charged hydrogen bond acceptor atom, e.g. oxygen or nitrogen. The analysis of hydrogen bonds can give valuable insights into the stability of a ligand-protein complex and guide modification of a lead molecule to improve its activity. The strength of a hydrogen bond can be estimated by analyzing angles and distances between donor, hydrogen and acceptor atoms. A small distance and an angle close to 180° indicate a strong bond, while bigger distances and smaller angles point towards a weaker bond (Fig
