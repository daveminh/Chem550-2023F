These boxes are of finite size, which results in problems for molecules at or near the box boundaries. With which molecules should those interact? Periodic boundary conditions can avoid such boundary artifacts by simulating a theoretically infinite system. Molecules at one boundary of the box thereby interact with molecules at the boundary on the other side of the box. This mimics a situation, in which the simulation box is surrounded by replicas of itself. When visualizing such MD simulations, one can often observe that particles leave the box at one side (Fig. 3). However, they re-appear at the same time on the other side of the box with the same velocity. For simulations under periodic boundary conditions, it is recommended to use a simulation box large enough, so that the simulated macromolecule does not come into contact with neighboring images of itself."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_FOBpiiQ-abC"},"source":["![MD_water.gif](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/raw/d1ded86bb2c82ef088cc5145d0bcb997f6eab7dd/teachopencadd/talktorials/018_md_simulation/images/MD_water.gif)\n","\n","**Figure 3**: Molecular dynamics simulation of water molecules with periodic boundary conditions (Kmckiern via [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MD_water.gif))."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DzO12MFp2P48"},"source":["With our configured force field we can now  use the  [OpenMM Modeller](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#model-building-and-editing) class to create the MD environment, a simulation box which contains the complex and is filled with a solvent.
