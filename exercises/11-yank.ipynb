Because the overall chain must obey detailed balance, we count each transition as contributing 0.5 counts toward the $i \\rightarrow j$ direction and 0.5 toward the $j \\rightarrow i$ direction.  This has the advantage of ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting transition matrix among alchemical states are purely real.\n","\n","Interpreting the Perron (subdominant/second) Eigenvalue \n","----------------------------------------------------\n","\n","If the subdominant eigenvalue would have been unity, then the chain would be *decomposable*, meaning that it completely separated into two separate sets of alchemical states that did not mix.  This would have been an indication of poor phase space overlap between some alchemical states.\n","\n","In practice, it's a great idea to monitor these statistics as the simulation is running, even if no data is discarded to equilibration at that point.  They give not only a good idea of whether sufficient mixing is occurring, but it provides a lower bound on the mixing time in configuration space.\n","\n","If the configuration $x$ sampling is infinitely fast so that $x$ can be considered to be at equilibrium given the instantaneous permutation $S$ of alchemical state assignments, the subdominant eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 \\in [0,1]$ gives an estimate of the mixing time of the overall $(X,S)$ chain:\n","    \n","$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{1 - \\lambda_2}$$\n","\n","Now, in most cases, the configuration $x$ sampling is *not* infinitely fast, but at least we can use $\\tau$ to get a very crude estimate of how quickly each replica relaxes in $(X,S)$ space."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Part 3 - Analysis of YANK results"],"metadata":{"id":"fF8HIfQxlxrf"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"YOXomMb2P0fo"},"outputs":[],"source":["free_energy_trace_figure = report.free_energy_trace(discard_from_start=1, n_trace=10)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### --> Does the binding free energy estimate appear converged?
