# History

* In Spring 2020, I taught [Chem 456](https://github.com/daveminh/Chem456-2020S) for the first time. Most of the examples were designed to be run in a computer lab.
* In Summer 2021, I organized [An International Workshop in Modeling Biological Macromolecules](https://ccbatiit.github.io/modelingworkshop2021/index.html) and then ran a small session of Chem 456. Most examples were accessible through a virtual machine.
* In Spring 2022, I organized [another version of the workshop](https://ccbatiit.github.io/modelingworkshop/index.html), this time held in person in Baranquilla, Colombia. Lectures were simultaneously translated into Spanish! Examples were migrated to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), allowing easy access from computer with an internet connection.

# Sources

In the Spring 2022 workshop, exercises were adapted from
* [IIBM3202 Molecular Modeling and Simulation](https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202/) from the Institute for Biological and Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, and
* [TeachOpenCADD](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd)
