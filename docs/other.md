# Group Work and Academic Honesty

You are allowed and encouraged to help each other on all the assignments. Indeed, you must work in a group for the final project, presentation, and report. However, you should prepare your own unique ethics discussion summary, biological target presentation, and biological target report.

Quizzes must be completed individually. Seating may be assigned during quizzes. Cheating on a quiz will lead to failing the quiz. Students are expected to adhere to the [IIT Code of Academic Honesty](https://www.iit.edu/student-affairs/student-handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty). All violations of academic integrity will be reported to academichonesty@iit.edu.
